# React-SPA
Simple react app that I use for studying react-router-dom.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Vite, React

A simple SPA website build with [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) for initial folder structure and [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) for front-end. 

## Take Aways:

- Basic knowledge for react-router-dom
  - createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider
  - component (Outlet)
  - hooks (userParams, useNavigate)
  - built in anchor tag (Link, NavLink)
  - relative and absolute path
  - defining index, error and dynamic page
